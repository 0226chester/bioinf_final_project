--- Biological Interpretation ---
1. Hub-Hub: Interactions between highly connected proteins, potentially bridging modules.
2. Hub-Peripheral: Interactions connecting hubs to less connected proteins, often regulatory.
3. Peripheral-Peripheral: Interactions between less connected proteins, often within specific pathways/complexes.
4. Confidence/Precision Patterns: Observe if the model is more confident or precise for certain types of interactions.
