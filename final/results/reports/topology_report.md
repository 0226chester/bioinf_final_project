    - 19 (Node Index: 18)
    - 24 (Node Index: 23)
    - 30 (Node Index: 29)
    - 52 (Node Index: 51)
Network modularity (avg. clustering coefficient): 0.3763
Size of largest connected component: 5597
Diameter of largest connected component: 14

--- Biological Interpretation ---
1. Network Structure: Scale-free topology is common. Hubs are key.
2. Functional Implications: High clustering suggests complexes. Diameter indicates separation.
3. Hub Proteins: Often essential, conserved, coordinators. Disruptions can be severe.
4. Link Prediction Context: Novel links likely within modules. Similar patterns imply shared function.
